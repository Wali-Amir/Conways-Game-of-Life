# Conway's Game of Life
# Description
I did this for enjoyment. After building Snake, I saw that Robert Heaton also had a project to build Conway's Game of Life, and I decided to build that as well.

# Gameplay

# Installation
Download the two .py files and ensure that they are placed in the same folder. Run the game_of_life.py file in a software of your choice. The game relies is automatic and runs infinitely until stopped with a break sequence. There are two pieces of code in the file. One starts with a random grid, and the other is to read a pre-set grid from a text file. There are 3 text files in this repository. Comment out the piece of code you do not want to run.
